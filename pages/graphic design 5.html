       <h3> GRAPHIC DESIGN 5 </h3>
        <span>Maganetic Magazine</span>
        <p>The course assignment involves the design of printed magazine for an
online magazine called Magnetic magazine with headquartered in
Denver, United State. The company wants a curated version of what is
currently trending on their website in a printed publication to be handed
out at events (such as music festivals and art shows) for free. They want
the magazine to have a long shelf-life and strong impact. They want it to
be a calm space, away from the noise of the world wide web and social
media platforms. The printed magazine will not be location specific as it
will be distributed at random events all around the world. It should be
able to be printed in the United States, but also in Europe, for example.
They also want the magazine to be published four times a year, one for
each season, to specifically promote events according to the theme of the
season.
We were asked to develop a concept for the printed format of the
magazine, and to ensure that the following are included in our design:
<br>• The magazine cover should feature a unique custom-made design; inspired by an
article that is also going to be in the magazine
<br>• The layout design should be made for only four articles choosing from the
sustainability; gaming; news; music; culture; gear; events; industry; travel and
camping sections
<br>• The contents of the selected articles should be used as it is without modifications
<br>• The printed magazine’s layout should not only be pleasing to the eye, but it should
also be easy to read
<br>• The content should appeal to an international audience and can promote travelling
abroad to music festivals.</p>
